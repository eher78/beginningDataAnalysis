# beginningDataAnalysis
Starting Data Analysis on one of my favorite things, video games!

During my winter break of 2022, I decided to take up a new skill. That is to start learning and using about Pandas library and MatPlotLib. 

For this, I am going to be looking at exploring the potentials of a dataset and my own questions about a video game dataset to analyze. 

I have three questions basically I want to know just to begin:

- The different types of consoles or systems used in a video game company (In this case, Nintendo)
- Plotting the amount of a certain game sold over a period of 30 years.
- Plotting the total amount of sales over a year period.

For this, I used the Nintendo Game Dataset which has values which includes:
- Name
- Developer
- Publisher
- Release Date
- Sales
- Platform
- Genre

Note that this is for my own exploration and interest and that I could use any feedback and suggestions on where to take this next.

Thanks!
